# Song Book - Mobile Application - Android

[![Moove It](https://circleci.com/gh/moove-it/react-native-template.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/moove-it/react-native-template?branch=master)

This project aims to be digitilize the tradition paper books and for announcements. It provides a clear and organized structure, core dependencies

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js > 12](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [JDK > 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Android Studio and Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Base dependencies

- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for networking.
- [prop-types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) to type-check our components exposed properties.
- [react-native-config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config) to manage envionments.
- [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) navigation library.
- [AsyncStorage](https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage) local storage library
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Context API](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext)

## Folder structure

This template follows a very simple project structure:

- `api` : contains all the http request along with firebase
- `assets`: Asset folder to store all images, vectors, etc.
  - `icons` : all the icons required for the app
  - `images` : all the imaged used in the applications
- `UI` : small UI reusable components used widely in the application
- `components`: Folder to store any common component that you use through your app (such as a generic button)
  - `manageNotifications` : used for admin management of notifications
  - `manageSongs` : used for admin management of songs
- `constants`: Folder to store global styles such as Colors.
- `reducers`: This folder have all the reducers, and expose the combined result using its `index.js`
- `screens`: Folder that contains all your application screens/features.
- `store`: Folder to put all context api and the store.
- `App.js`: Main component that starts your whole app.
- `index.js`: Entry point of your application as per React-Native standards.

## Splash screen customization

To customize the splash screen (logo and background color) use the CLI provided in the [official docs](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-bootsplash#assets-generation).

## Setup environments

### Using scripts from console

The template already has scripts to execute the project calling a specific environment defined into the package.json file. Keep in mind that if you are going to create new `envs` you have to define the script to build the project properly.

To define which env you want to use, just keep the structure `yarn [platform]: [environment]`

DEV: `yarn ios` or `yarn android`

STG: `yarn ios:staging` or `yarn android:staging`

PROD: `yarn ios:prod` o `yarn android:prod`

Also, you can use npm following the same rule as before: `npm run ios:staging`

Modify the environment variables files in root folder (`.env.development`, `.env.production` and `.env.staging`)

#### Android

A map associating builds with env files is already defined in `app/build.gradle` you can modify or add environments if needed.

For multiple enviroments to work you would need to change `-keep class [YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME].BuildConfig { *; }` on `proguard-rules.pro` file.

#### iOS

The basic idea in iOS is to have one scheme per environment file, so you can easily alternate between them.

To create a new scheme:

- In the Xcode menu, go to Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme
- Click Duplicate Scheme on the bottom
- Give it a proper name on the top left. For instance: "qa"
- Then edit the newly created scheme to make it use a different env file. From the same "manage scheme" window:

  Expand the "Build" tab on the left menu

  - Click "Pre-actions", and under the plus sign select "New Run Script Action"
  - Where it says "Type a script or drag a script file", type: `echo ".env.qa" > /tmp/envfile` replacing `.env.qa` with your file.

- Also, you will need to select the executable for the new schema:

  Expand the "Run" tab on the left menu

  - Under the "Executable" dropdown select the ".app" you would like to use for that schema

## Styleguide

For coding styling, we decided to go with ESLint and [React Native community's styleguide](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-react-native-community#readme).
